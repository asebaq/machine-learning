# Machine learning basic algorithms

In this repo I'm attemptting to implement some of the basic yet famous machine learning algorithms using Python.

## Features
1. Supervised Learning
  - [x] Linear Regression
  - [x] Logistic Regression
  - [x] Support Vector Machine
  - [x] KNN
  - [ ] Decision Trees
  - [ ] Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
  - [ ] PCA
  - [ ] K-Means
  - [ ] DBSCAN
